### Content
This dataset contains a small subset of images from the Kaggle Dogs vs Cats competition.

Approximately half of the images have been rotated 90 degrees (clockwise). This is used as an exercise to build a deep learning model that can tell whether an image is upright or sideways, and that exercise is part of the Deep Learning Education program.

The data is divided into a directory of training data and a directory of validation data. Each of those directories is subdivided into a directory of sideways (rotated) images and a directory of upright (unrotated) images.

Images are selected based on having an aspect ratio between 0.85 and 1.2, as well as a height of at least 200 pixels.
